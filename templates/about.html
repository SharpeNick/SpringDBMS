    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Thank you for stopping by. We are a group of 4 that are working on a project for our DBMS class. The purpose of our application is so that customers can quickly get in contact with a healthcare practitioner, ask important questions, and pay bills when you are ready to. We hope that our app can streamline the healthcare process.</p>
