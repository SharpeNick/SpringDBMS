# SpringDBMS
This is a healthcare app that was created for our DBMS class. 
Note: This uses flask framework and python. You will need both of those for this project. In order to use this it's a good idea to go over to https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/

P.S. You must create a .venv folder in your project folder for this to work. Without it you will get errors. To do this use:
> mkdir myproject
> cd myproject
> py -3 -m venv .venv
> .venv\Scripts\activate

*This code was taken from Flask's website.


While working on this app Use: flask --app main run --debug
This starts the developer in debug mode so that when you refresh the page you can see the changes you made.

We may want to have multiple branches so we do not lose information.
